I have made an application rendered in the browser using javascript,
jQuery, CSS, and HTML.

As a gamer, I want minesweeper similar game, so that i can try to guess correctly 
and beat the game.

Game Description:
You have cards you have to turn over. The card can either be a bomb,
a stick, or a get out of jail free card.
3 stick and you win. 1 bomb and you lose. A get out of
jail free card means you get another turn.
