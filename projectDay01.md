Guesstimate how long much time and effort you 
think each user story will take (1 being easy, 
an hour or less, 2 being half a day, 
3 being full day or more )

create lists for "IceBox", "Sprint", "Doing", 
and "Done!"
Create cards for each of your user stories..
Create cards for additional tasks (repo setup, 
read docs on...)..
Label each card based on your guesstimated 
effort green (1), yellow (2), red (3)..
Decide which user stories you're going to tackle 
in this sprint and move them to "Sprint"..
Place any left over user stories in "IceBox"..


How are you going to layout your game?
very carefully :D
Draw out some sketches for the different "states" 
of your game
move two: player is occupying a cell, all rest are null
move 3: player occupying a cell, a cell is rendered
in one of its possible states, all other cells null.
What should it look like before someone plays?
all cells === null
What should it look like when a player takes a turn?
prompts player
What should it look like when a player wins or loses?
prompts player
logic needs to be fullfilled, like hit a 'mine' 
or player collects all set pieces (minesweeper twist)

** brief description of your project and the 
rules of your game.

player must click cells to uncover set pieces or
'mines'

mvp will be to only have these two events.
extras could be multiple game wins
bonus round if hit hat trick or game wins 3 out of 5
bonus round could be different
mines could be different
mines could trigger a animate.css
